# Experimental Features

We believe in pushing the boundaries of what a code editor can be. But as a small team with high standards, we often don't have the time to polish everything we come up with. With the `experiments` setting, you can play around with these ideas too. These features should never crash Zed or cause you to lose work, but they may be glitchy or integrate poorly with the rest of Zed.
